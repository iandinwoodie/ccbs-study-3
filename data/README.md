# data

This directory contains the various stages of study data used for analysis.
Brief descriptions of each stage are provided below in order from least to most
modified.

## Raw Data

The raw data (`raw-owners.csv` and `raw-dogs.csv`) is a dump of the collected
responses from the electric data capture (EDC) platform Typeform. The raw data
is split across two datasets because information about a dog owner was collected
separately from the information about each owned dog. The tables below are for
illustrative purposes to convey the general structure of the data.

### Raw Owner Data

owner-id | field-1 | ... | field-n
--- | --- | --- | ---
abc123 | answer-1 | ... | answer-n
xyz456 | answer-1 | ... | answer-n

### Raw Dog Data

dog-name | field-1 | ... | field-n | owner-id
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
mark | answer-1 | ... | answer-n | abc123
mary | answer-1 | ... | answer-n | abc123
kevin | answer-1 | ... | answer-n | xyz456

## Tidy Data

The tidy data (`tidy.Rds`) is generated by the data tidying notebook
(`../src/notebook-0-tidy.Rmd`). It consists of the merged data from the two raw
data sets with irrelevant columns dropped and adjustments made to the remaining
columns. The tables below is for illustrative purposes to convey the general
structure of the data.

owner-id | owner-field-1 | ... | owner-field-n | dog-name | dog-field-1 | ... | dog-field-n
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
abc123 | owner-answer-1 | ... | owner-answer-n | mark | dog-answer-1 | ... | dog-answer-n
abc123 | owner-answer-1 | ... | owner-answer-n | mary | dog-answer-1 | ... | dog-answer-n 
xyz456 | owner-answer-1 | ... | owner-answer-n | kevin | dog-answer-1 | ... | dog-answer-n
